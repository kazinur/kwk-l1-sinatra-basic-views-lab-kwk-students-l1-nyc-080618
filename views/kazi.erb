<h1> About me </h2> 
<p> Hi there! My name is Kazi Nur. I am currently a Junior attending Brooklyn International High School where students come  from different country with various backgrounds. I am a very focused, organized and active person. I am a dreamer of my future and determined to make my dreams true in real life. Before I wasn't that outgoing person but now I loved traveling. Growing up I always looked up to my dad since he is my rolemodel and he possess every good qualities. He taught me to be brave, gave me freedom when I needed, motivated me when I needed and supported me in my down time. People especially my relatives say that I look more alike my dad since we have same height, face shape and unique hairline. My aunt was important to me because I adore her a lot and so she. She treats me like her own daughter. My favorite actress is Prianka Chopra. I love her style and sense of humor.</p>

<p> My favorite cultural activity is Eid when we celebrate happiness with everyone. We laugh a lot, eat bunch of delicious food, dress up, visit other people's house and thank god. My favorite music genre is World music because I love to listen miusics from all over the world. In my playlist, I have korean, japanese, bengali, indian, spanish, english and so on. My favorite clothing brand is Forever 21 and H&M. My alltime favorite place to take an out-town guest would be korea town because I just love the vibe out there. There's so many korean foods that you can try and shop so many cute korean stuffs like keychain, phone case, merch and so on.</p>
